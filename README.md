# Traffic Simulation & RL - Hackathon Project

A traffic simulation and reinforcement learning system for intelligent traffic signal control using SUMO.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- SUMO (install with `brew install sumo` on macOS)

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run demo
python demo_rl_training.py
```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Sumo_env/` - SUMO simulation files and configurations
- `dashboard_*.py` - Dashboard and metrics visualization
- `generate_traffic.py` - Traffic generation utilities
- `demo_rl_training.py` - RL training demonstration
- `traffic_api.py` - API endpoints

## 🔧 Key Features

- Multi-scenario traffic simulation (uniform, asymmetric, tidal, congested)
- Reinforcement learning for traffic signal optimization
- Real-time dashboard monitoring
- Configurable traffic patterns

## 👥 Team Collaboration

- Create feature branches for your work
- Test changes before pushing
- Update this README with new features
