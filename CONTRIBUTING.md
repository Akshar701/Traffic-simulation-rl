   ```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function parameters and return values
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Example of Good Code Style

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
import numpy as np

def calculate_traffic_flow(
    vehicle_counts: List[int], 
    time_intervals: List[float]
) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculate traffic flow metrics from vehicle count data.
    
    Args:
        vehicle_counts: List of vehicle counts per interval
        time_intervals: List of time intervals in seconds
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing flow rate and average density
    """
    if not vehicle_counts or not time_intervals:
        raise ValueError("Input lists cannot be empty")
    
    flow_rate = sum(vehicle_counts) / sum(time_intervals)
    avg_density = np.mean(vehicle_counts)
    
    return {
        "flow_rate": flow_rate,
        "avg_density": avg_density
    }
```

### File Organization

- Keep related functionality in the same module
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local
- Separate configuration from logic

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

### Example Test

```python
import pytest
from traffic_metrics import calculate_traffic_flow

def test_calculate_traffic_flow_success():
    """Test successful traffic flow calculation."""
    vehicle_counts = [10, 15, 20]
    time_intervals = [60, 60, 60]
    
    result = calculate_traffic_flow(vehicle_counts, time_intervals)
    
    assert result["flow_rate"] == 0.75  # 45 vehicles / 180 seconds
    assert result["avg_density"] == 15.0

def test_calculate_traffic_flow_empty_input():
    """Test that empty input raises ValueError."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Input lists cannot be empty"):
        calculate_traffic_flow([], [])
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=.

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_traffic_metrics.py

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- Use **docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- Follow **Google docstring** format
- Include examples in docstrings when helpful
- Document exceptions that may be raised

### Example Docstring

```python
def optimize_traffic_signals(
    intersection_data: Dict[str, Any],
    optimization_algorithm: str = "q_learning"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Optimize traffic signal timing using specified algorithm.
    
    Args:
        intersection_data: Dictionary containing intersection configuration
            and current traffic state
        optimization_algorithm: Algorithm to use for optimization.
            Options: "q_learning", "deep_q", "policy_gradient"
            
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing optimized signal timings and performance metrics
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If optimization_algorithm is not supported
        RuntimeError: If optimization fails to converge
        
    Example:
        >>> data = {"lanes": 4, "traffic_flow": [100, 80, 120, 90]}
        >>> result = optimize_traffic_signals(data, "q_learning")
        >>> print(result["optimized_timings"])
        [30, 25, 35, 30]
    """
```
